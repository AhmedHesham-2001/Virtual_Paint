# Virtual_Paint
using opencv for a Virtual Paint project project including (color detection,object detection)
the code has three main functions findColor(img,myColors, myColorValues), getContours(img), drawOnCanvas(mypoints,myColorValues)

findColor is to detect the color(the pen you use for example) and make a circle on that colored object 
getContours is a function used to get the x ,y,h,w of the colored object and used in FindColor function
drawOnCanvas is to draw on the webcam feed the painting of the colors that where detected 



i would like to thank mr.Murtaza for his youtube video where i learned opencv
